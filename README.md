Implementation of the three major steps of a local feature matching algorithm (detecting interest points, creating local feature descriptors, and matching feature vectors) using two different versions of the local feature descriptor.

Interest point detection 
Local feature description with a simple normalized patch feature 
Feature matching 
Local feature description with the SIFT feature
